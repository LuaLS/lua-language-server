--- Returns (and optionally sets) the current PRNG state (an array of 8 Lua
--- numbers with 32-bit integer values) currently used by the JIT compiler.
---
--- When the `state` argument is non-nil, it is expected to be an array of up to 8
--- unsigned Lua numbers, each with value less than 2\*\*32-1. This will set the
--- current PRNG state and return the state that was overridden.
---
--- **Note:** For backward compatibility, `state` argument can also be an unsigned
--- Lua number less than 2\*\*32-1.
---
--- **Note:** When the `state` argument is an array and less than 8 numbers, or the
--- `state` is a number, the remaining positions are filled with zeros.
---
--- Usage:
---
--- ```lua
--- local state = jit.prngstate()
--- local oldstate = jit.prngstate{ a, b, c, ... }
---
--- jit.prngstate(32) -- {32, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
--- jit.prngstate{432, 23, 50} -- {432, 23, 50, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
--- ```
---
--- **Note:** This API has no effect if LuaJIT is compiled with
--- `-DLUAJIT_DISABLE_JIT`, and will return a table with all `0`.
---
---@param  state?    integer[]
---@return integer[] state
function jit.prngstate(state) end
