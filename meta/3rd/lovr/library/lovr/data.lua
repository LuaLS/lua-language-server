---
---The `lovr.data` module provides functions for accessing underlying data representations for several LÃ–VR objects.
---
---@class lovr.data
lovr.data = {}

---
---Creates a new Blob.
---
---@overload fun(contents: string, name?: string):lovr.Blob
---@overload fun(source: lovr.Blob, name?: string):lovr.Blob
---@param size number # The amount of data to allocate for the Blob, in bytes.  All of the bytes will be filled with zeroes.
---@param name? string # A name for the Blob (used in error messages)
---@return lovr.Blob blob # The new Blob.
function lovr.data.newBlob(size, name) end

---
---Creates a new Image.
---
---Image data can be loaded and decoded from an image file, or a raw block of pixels with a specified width, height, and format can be created.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---The supported image file formats are png, jpg, hdr, dds (DXT1, DXT3, DXT5), ktx, and astc.
---
---Only 2D textures are supported for DXT/ASTC.
---
---Currently textures loaded as KTX need to be in DXT/ASTC formats.
---
---@overload fun(width: number, height: number, format?: lovr.TextureFormat, data?: lovr.Blob):lovr.Image
---@overload fun(source: lovr.Image):lovr.Image
---@overload fun(blob: lovr.Blob, flip?: boolean):lovr.Image
---@param filename string # The filename of the image to load.
---@param flip? boolean # Whether to vertically flip the image on load.  This should be true for normal textures, and false for textures that are going to be used in a cubemap.
---@return lovr.Image image # The new Image.
function lovr.data.newImage(filename, flip) end

---
---Loads a 3D model from a file.
---
---The supported 3D file formats are OBJ and glTF.
---
---@overload fun(blob: lovr.Blob):lovr.ModelData
---@param filename string # The filename of the model to load.
---@return lovr.ModelData modelData # The new ModelData.
function lovr.data.newModelData(filename) end

---
---Creates a new Rasterizer from a TTF file.
---
---@overload fun(filename: string, size?: number):lovr.Rasterizer
---@overload fun(blob: lovr.Blob, size?: number):lovr.Rasterizer
---@param size? number # The resolution to render the fonts at, in pixels.  Higher resolutions use more memory and processing power but may provide better quality results for some fonts/situations.
---@return lovr.Rasterizer rasterizer # The new Rasterizer.
function lovr.data.newRasterizer(size) end

---
---Creates a new Sound.
---
---A sound can be loaded from an audio file, or it can be created empty with capacity for a certain number of audio frames.
---
---When loading audio from a file, use the `decode` option to control whether compressed audio should remain compressed or immediately get decoded to raw samples.
---
---When creating an empty sound, the `contents` parameter can be set to `'stream'` to create an audio stream.
---
---On streams, `Sound:setFrames` will always write to the end of the stream, and `Sound:getFrames` will always read the oldest samples from the beginning.
---
---The number of frames in the sound is the total capacity of the stream's buffer.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---It is highly recommended to use an audio format that matches the format of the audio module: `f32` sample formats at a sample rate of 48000, with 1 channel for spatialized sources or 2 channels for unspatialized sources.
---
---This will avoid the need to convert audio during playback, which boosts performance of the audio thread.
---
---The WAV importer supports 16, 24, and 32 bit integer data and 32 bit floating point data.
---
---The data must be mono, stereo, or 4-channel full-sphere ambisonic.
---
---The `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` extension is supported.
---
---Ambisonic channel layouts are supported for import (but not yet for playback).
---
---Ambisonic data can be loaded from WAV files.
---
---It must be first-order full-sphere ambisonic data with 4 channels.
---
---If the WAV has a `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` chunk with an `AMBISONIC_B_FORMAT` format GUID, then the data is understood as using the AMB format with Furse-Malham channel ordering and normalization.
---
---*All other* 4-channel files are assumed to be using the AmbiX format with ACN channel ordering and SN3D normalization.
---
---AMB files will get automatically converted to AmbiX on import, so ambisonic Sounds will always be in a consistent format.
---
---OGG and MP3 files will always have the `f32` format when loaded.
---
---@overload fun(filename: string, decode: boolean):lovr.Sound
---@overload fun(blob: lovr.Blob, decode: boolean):lovr.Sound
---@param frames number # The number of frames the Sound can hold.
---@param format? lovr.SampleFormat # The sample data type.
---@param channels? lovr.ChannelLayout # The channel layout.
---@param sampleRate? number # The sample rate, in Hz.
---@param contents? any # A Blob containing raw audio samples to use as the initial contents, 'stream' to create an audio stream, or `nil` to leave the data initialized to zero.
---@return lovr.Sound sound # Sounds good.
function lovr.data.newSound(frames, format, channels, sampleRate, contents) end

---
---A Blob is an object that holds binary data.
---
---It can be passed to most functions that take filename arguments, like `lovr.graphics.newModel` or `lovr.audio.newSource`.
---
---Blobs aren't usually necessary for simple projects, but they can be really helpful if:
---
---- You need to work with low level binary data, potentially using the LuaJIT FFI for increased
---  performance.
---- You are working with data that isn't stored as a file, such as programmatically generated data
---  or a string from a network request.
---- You want to load data from a file once and then use it to create many different objects.
---
---A Blob's size cannot be changed once it is created.
---
---@class lovr.Blob
local Blob = {}

---
---Returns the filename the Blob was loaded from, or the custom name given to it when it was created.
---
---This label is also used in error messages.
---
---@return string name # The name of the Blob.
function Blob:getName() end

---
---Returns a raw pointer to the Blob's data.
---
---This can be used to interface with other C libraries using the LuaJIT FFI.
---
---Use this only if you know what you're doing!
---
---@return userdata pointer # A pointer to the data.
function Blob:getPointer() end

---
---Returns the size of the Blob's contents, in bytes.

function Blob:getSize() end

---

---
---@return string data # The Blob's data.
function Blob:getString() end

---
---An Image stores raw 2D pixel info for `Texture`s.
---
---It has a width, height, and format.
---
---The Image can be initialized with the contents of an image file or it can be created with uninitialized contents.
---
---The supported image formats are `png`, `jpg`, `hdr`, `dds`, `ktx`, and `astc`.
---
---Usually you can just use Textures, but Image can be useful if you want to manipulate individual pixels, load Textures in a background thread, or use the FFI to efficiently access the raw image data.
---
---@class lovr.Image
local Image = {}

---
---Encodes the Image to an uncompressed png.
---
---This intended mainly for debugging.
---
---@return lovr.Blob blob # A new Blob containing the PNG image data.
function Image:encode() end

---

---
---Returns the value of a pixel of the Image.

function Image:getPixel(x, y) end

---
---Returns the width of the Image, in pixels.
---
---@return number width # The width of the Image, in pixels.
function Image:getWidth() end

---
---Copies a rectangle of pixels from one Image to this one.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---The two Images must have the same pixel format.
---
---Compressed images cannot be copied.
---
---The rectangle cannot go outside the dimensions of the source or destination textures.

---
---@param x number # The x coordinate of the pixel to set (0-indexed).
---@param y number # The y coordinate of the pixel to set (0-indexed).
---@param r number # The red component of the pixel, from 0.0 to 1.0.

---@param b number # The blue component of the pixel, from 0.0 to 1.0.
---@param a? number # The alpha component of the pixel, from 0.0 to 1.0.

---
---A ModelData is a container object that loads and holds data contained in 3D model files.
---
---This can include a variety of things like the node structure of the asset, the vertex data it contains, contains, the `Image` and `Material` properties, and any included animations.
---
---The current supported formats are OBJ, glTF, and STL.
---
---Usually you can just load a `Model` directly, but using a `ModelData` can be helpful if you want to load models in a thread or access more low-level information about the Model.

---
---A Sound stores the data for a sound.
---
---The supported sound formats are OGG, WAV, and MP3.
---
---Sounds cannot be played directly.
---
---Instead, there are `Source` objects in `lovr.audio` that are used for audio playback.
---
---All Source objects are backed by one of these Sounds, and multiple Sources can share a single Sound to reduce memory usage.
---
---Metadata
------
---
---Sounds hold a fixed number of frames.
---
---Each frame contains one audio sample for each channel. The `SampleFormat` of the Sound is the data type used for each sample (floating point, integer, etc.).
---
---The Sound has a `ChannelLayout`, representing the number of audio channels and how they map to speakers (mono, stereo, etc.).
---
---The sample rate of the Sound indicates how many frames should be played per second.
---
---The duration of the sound (in seconds) is the number of frames divided by the sample rate.
---
---Compression
------
---
---Sounds can be compressed.
---
---Compressed sounds are stored compressed in memory and are decoded as they are played.
---
---This uses a lot less memory but increases CPU usage during playback.
---
---OGG and MP3 are compressed audio formats.
---
---When creating a sound from a compressed format, there is an option to immediately decode it, storing it uncompressed in memory.
---
---It can be a good idea to decode short sound effects, since they won't use very much memory even when uncompressed and it will improve CPU usage.
---
---Compressed sounds can not be written to using `Sound:setFrames`.
---
---Streams
------
---
---Sounds can be created as a stream by passing `'stream'` as their contents when creating them. Audio frames can be written to the end of the stream, and read from the beginning.
---
---This works well for situations where data is being generated in real time or streamed in from some other data source.
---
---Sources can be backed by a stream and they'll just play whatever audio is pushed to the stream. The audio module also lets you use a stream as a "sink" for an audio device.
---
---For playback devices, this works like loopback, so the mixed audio from all playing Sources will get written to the stream.
---
---For capture devices, all the microphone input will get written to the stream. Conversion between sample formats, channel layouts, and sample rates will happen automatically.
---
---Keep in mind that streams can still only hold a fixed number of frames.
---
---If too much data is written before it is read, older frames will start to get overwritten.
---
---Similary, it's possible to read too much data without writing fast enough.
---
---Ambisonics
------
---
---Ambisonic sounds can be imported from WAVs, but can not yet be played.
---
---Sounds with a `ChannelLayout` of `ambisonic` are stored as first-order full-sphere ambisonics using the AmbiX format (ACN channel ordering and SN3D channel normalization).
---
---The AMB format is supported for import and will automatically get converted to AmbiX.
---
---See `lovr.data.newSound` for more info.
---
---@class lovr.Sound

---Returns a Blob containing the raw bytes of the Sound.

---
---@return lovr.Blob blob # The Blob instance containing the bytes for the `Sound`.
function Sound:getBlob() end

---
---Returns the number of frames that can be written to the Sound.
---
---For stream sounds, this is the number of frames that can be written without overwriting existing data.

---
---@return number capacity # The number of frames that can be written to the Sound.
function Sound:getCapacity() end

---
---Returns the number of channels in the Sound.
