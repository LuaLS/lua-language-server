---
---The `lovr.audio` module is responsible for playing sound effects and music.
---
---To play a sound, create a `Source` object and call `Source:play` on it.
---
---Currently ogg, wav, and mp3 audio formats are supported.
---
---@class lovr.audio

---
---Returns the global air absorption coefficients for the medium.
---
---This affects Sources that have the `absorption` effect enabled, causing audio volume to drop off with distance as it is absorbed by the medium it's traveling through (air, water, etc.).
---
---The difference between absorption and falloff is that absorption is more subtle and is frequency-dependent, so higher-frequency bands can get absorbed more quickly than lower ones.
---
---This can be used to apply "underwater" effects and stuff.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Absorption is currently only supported by the phonon spatializer.
---
---The frequency bands correspond to `400Hz`, `2.5KHz`, and `15KHz`.
---
---The default coefficients are `.0002`, `.0017`, and `.0182` for low, mid, and high.
---

---
---Returns a list of playback or capture devices.
---

---Returns the name of the active spatializer (`simple`, `oculus`, or `phonon`).

---
---When a Source is playing, it will send audio to the speakers.
---
---Sources do not play automatically when they are created.

---
---1.0 results in a full dipole shape that can be heard only from the front and back.
---
---0.5 results in a cardioid shape that can only be heard from one direction.

---
---The power is a number that controls how "focused" or sharp the shape is.
---
---Lower power values can be heard from a wider set of angles.
