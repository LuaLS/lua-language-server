---@meta

---
---Provides an interface for modifying and retrieving information about the program's window.
---
---@class love.window
love.window = {}

---
---Closes the window. It can be reopened with love.window.setMode.
---
function love.window.close() end

---
---Converts a number from pixels to density-independent units.
---
---The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.window.fromPixels(1600) would return 800 in that case.
---
---This function converts coordinates from pixels to the size users are expecting them to display at onscreen. love.window.toPixels does the opposite. The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.
---
---Most LÃ–VE functions return values and expect arguments in terms of pixels rather than density-independent units.
---
---@overload fun(px: number, py: number):number, number
---@param pixelvalue number # A number in pixels to convert to density-independent units.
---@return number value # The converted number, in density-independent units.
function love.window.fromPixels(pixelvalue) end

---
---Gets the DPI scale factor associated with the window.
---
---The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.window.getDPIScale() would return 2.0 in that case.
---
---The love.window.fromPixels and love.window.toPixels functions can also be used to convert between units.
---
---The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.

---
---Checks if the game window has mouse focus.
---
---@return boolean focus # True if the window has mouse focus or false if not.
function love.window.hasMouseFocus() end

---
---Gets whether the display is allowed to sleep while the program is running.

---
---Gets whether the Window is currently maximized.

---
---Makes the window as large as possible.
---

---
function love.window.maximize() end

---
---Minimizes the window to the system's task bar / dock.
---
function love.window.minimize() end

---
---Causes the window to request the attention of the user if it is not in the foreground.

---
---Restores the size and position of the window if it was minimized or maximized.
