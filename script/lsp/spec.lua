---@field filterText? string
--- A string that should be inserted into a document when selecting
--- this completion. When omitted, the label is used as the insert text
--- for this item.
---
--- The `insertText` is subject to interpretation by the client side.
--- Some tools might not take the string literally. For example,
--- when code complete is requested for `con<cursor position>`
--- and a completion item with an `insertText` of `console` is provided,
--- VSCode will only insert `sole`. Therefore, it is
--- recommended to use `textEdit` instead since it avoids additional client
--- side interpretation.
---@field insertText? string
--- The format of the insert text. The format applies to both the
--- `insertText` property and the `newText` property of a provided
--- `textEdit`. If omitted, defaults to `InsertTextFormat.PlainText`.
---
--- Please note that the insertTextFormat doesn't apply to
--- `additionalTextEdits`.
---@field insertTextFormat? LSP.InsertTextFormat
--- How whitespace and indentation is handled during completion
--- item insertion. If not provided, the client's default value depends on

---@field insertTextMode? LSP.InsertTextMode
--- An edit which is applied to a document when selecting this completion.
--- When an edit is provided, the value of `insertText` is ignored.
---
--- *Note:* The range of the edit must be a single line range and it must
--- contain the position at which completion has been requested. Despite this
--- limitation, your edit can write multiple lines.
---
--- Most editors support two different operations when accepting a completion
--- item. One is to insert a completion text and the other is to replace an
--- existing text with a completion text. Since this can usually not be
--- predetermined by a server it can report both ranges. Clients need to
--- signal support for `InsertReplaceEdit`s via the
--- `textDocument.completion.completionItem.insertReplaceSupport` client
--- capability property.
---
--- *Note 1:* The text edit's range as well as both ranges from an insert
--- replace edit must be a single line and they must contain the position
--- at which completion has been requested. In both cases, the new text can
--- consist of multiple lines.
--- *Note 2:* If an `InsertReplaceEdit` is returned, the edit's insert range
--- must be a prefix of the edit's replace range, meaning it must be
--- contained in and starting at the same position.

---@field textEdit? LSP.TextEdit | LSP.InsertReplaceEdit
--- The edit text used if the completion item is part of a CompletionList and

--- If not provided and a list's default range is provided, the label

---@field textEditText? string
--- An optional array of additional text edits that are applied when
--- selecting this completion. Edits must not overlap (including the same
--- insert position) with the main edit nor with themselves.
---
--- Additional text edits should be used to change text unrelated to the
--- current cursor position (for example adding an import statement at the
--- top of the file if the completion item will insert an unqualified type).
