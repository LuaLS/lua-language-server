---
---@class love.joystick
love.joystick = {}

---
---Gets the full gamepad mapping string of the Joysticks which have the given GUID, or nil if the GUID isn't recognized as a gamepad.
---
---The mapping string contains binding information used to map the Joystick's buttons an axes to the standard gamepad layout, and can be used later with love.joystick.loadGamepadMappings.
---
---@param guid string # The GUID value to get the mapping string for.
---@return string mappingstring # A string containing the Joystick's gamepad mappings, or nil if the GUID is not recognized as a gamepad.

---Gets the number of connected joysticks.
---
---@return number joystickcount # The number of connected joysticks.
function love.joystick.getJoystickCount() end

---
---Gets a list of connected Joysticks.
---
---@return table joysticks # The list of currently connected Joysticks.
function love.joystick.getJoysticks() end

---
---Loads a gamepad mappings string or file created with love.joystick.saveGamepadMappings.
---
---It also recognizes any SDL gamecontroller mapping string, such as those created with Steam's Big Picture controller configure interface, or this nice database. If a new mapping is loaded for an already known controller GUID, the later version will overwrite the one currently loaded.
---
---@overload fun(mappings: string)
---@param filename string # The filename to load the mappings string from.
function love.joystick.loadGamepadMappings(filename) end

---
---Saves the virtual gamepad mappings of all recognized as gamepads and have either been recently used or their gamepad bindings have been modified.
---
---The mappings are stored as a string for use with love.joystick.loadGamepadMappings.
---
---@overload fun():string
---@param filename string # The filename to save the mappings string to.
---@return string mappings # The mappings string that was written to the file.
function love.joystick.saveGamepadMappings(filename) end

---
---Binds a virtual gamepad input to a button, axis or hat for all Joysticks of a certain type. For example, if this function is used with a GUID returned by a Dualshock 3 controller in OS X, the binding will affect Joystick:getGamepadAxis and Joystick:isGamepadDown for ''all'' Dualshock 3 controllers used with the game when run in OS X.
---
---LÖVE includes built-in gamepad bindings for many common controllers. This function lets you change the bindings or add new ones for types of Joysticks which aren't recognized as gamepads by default.
---
---The virtual gamepad buttons and axes are designed around the Xbox 360 controller layout.
---

---Gets the USB vendor ID, product ID, and product version numbers of joystick which consistent across operating systems.
---
---Can be used to show different icons, etc. for different gamepads.
---
---@return number vendorID # The USB vendor ID of the joystick.
---@return number productID # The USB product ID of the joystick.
---@return number productVersion # The product version of the joystick.
function Joystick:getDeviceInfo() end

---
---Gets a stable GUID unique to the type of the physical joystick which does not change over time. For example, all Sony Dualshock 3 controllers in OS X have the same GUID. The value is platform-dependent.
---
---@return string guid # The Joystick type's OS-dependent unique identifier.
function Joystick:getGUID() end

---
---Gets the direction of a virtual gamepad axis. If the Joystick isn't recognized as a gamepad or isn't connected, this function will always return 0.
---
---@param axis love.GamepadAxis # The virtual axis to be checked.
---@return number direction # Current value of the axis.
function Joystick:getGamepadAxis(axis) end

---
---Gets the button, axis or hat that a virtual gamepad input is bound to.
---
---@overload fun(self: love.Joystick, button: love.GamepadButton):love.JoystickInputType, number, love.JoystickHat
---@param axis love.GamepadAxis # The virtual gamepad axis to get the binding for.
---@return love.JoystickInputType inputtype # The type of input the virtual gamepad axis is bound to.
---@return number inputindex # The index of the Joystick's button, axis or hat that the virtual gamepad axis is bound to.
---@return love.JoystickHat hatdirection # The direction of the hat, if the virtual gamepad axis is bound to a hat. nil otherwise.
function Joystick:getGamepadMapping(axis) end

---
---Gets the full gamepad mapping string of this Joystick, or nil if it's not recognized as a gamepad.
---
---The mapping string contains binding information used to map the Joystick's buttons an axes to the standard gamepad layout, and can be used later with love.joystick.loadGamepadMappings.
---
---@return string mappingstring # A string containing the Joystick's gamepad mappings, or nil if the Joystick is not recognized as a gamepad.

function Joystick:getHat(hat) end

---
---Gets the number of hats on the joystick.
---
---@return number hats # How many hats the joystick has.
function Joystick:getHatCount() end

---
---Gets the joystick's unique identifier. The identifier will remain the same for the life of the game, even when the Joystick is disconnected and reconnected, but it '''will''' change when the game is re-launched.
---
---@return number id # The Joystick's unique identifier. Remains the same as long as the game is running.
---@return number instanceid # Unique instance identifier. Changes every time the Joystick is reconnected. nil if the Joystick is not connected.
function Joystick:getID() end

---Gets the name of the joystick.
---
---@return string name # The name of the joystick.
function Joystick:getName() end

---
---Gets the current vibration motor strengths on a Joystick with rumble support.
---
---@return number left # Current strength of the left vibration motor on the Joystick.

---
---Gets whether the Joystick is connected.
---
---@return boolean connected # True if the Joystick is currently connected, false otherwise.
function Joystick:isConnected() end

---
---Checks if a button on the Joystick is pressed.
---
---LÖVE 0.9.0 had a bug which required the button indices passed to Joystick:isDown to be 0-based instead of 1-based, for example button 1 would be 0 for this function. It was fixed in 0.9.1.
---
---@param buttonN number # The index of a button to check.
---@return boolean anyDown # True if any supplied button is down, false if not.
function Joystick:isDown(buttonN) end

---
---Gets whether the Joystick is recognized as a gamepad. If this is the case, the Joystick's buttons and axes can be used in a standardized manner across different operating systems and joystick models via Joystick:getGamepadAxis, Joystick:isGamepadDown, love.gamepadpressed, and related functions.
---
---LÖVE automatically recognizes most popular controllers with a similar layout to the Xbox 360 controller as gamepads, but you can add more with love.joystick.setGamepadMapping.
---
---@return boolean isgamepad # True if the Joystick is recognized as a gamepad, false otherwise.
function Joystick:isGamepad() end

---
---Checks if a virtual gamepad button on the Joystick is pressed. If the Joystick is not recognized as a Gamepad or isn't connected, then this function will always return false.
---
---@param buttonN love.GamepadButton # The gamepad button to check.
---@return boolean anyDown # True if any supplied button is down, false if not.
function Joystick:isGamepadDown(buttonN) end

---
---Gets whether the Joystick supports vibration.
---
---@return boolean supported # True if rumble / force feedback vibration is supported on this Joystick, false if not.
function Joystick:isVibrationSupported() end

---
---Sets the vibration motor speeds on a Joystick with rumble support. Most common gamepads have this functionality, although not all drivers give proper support. Use Joystick:isVibrationSupported to check.
