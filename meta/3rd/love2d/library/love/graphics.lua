---
---The primary responsibility for the love.graphics module is the drawing of lines, shapes, text, Images and other Drawable objects onto the screen. Its secondary responsibilities include loading external files (including Images and Fonts) into memory, creating specialized objects (such as ParticleSystems or Canvases) and managing screen geometry.
---
---LÃ–VE's coordinate system is rooted in the upper-left corner of the screen, which is at location (0, 0). The x axis is horizontal: larger values are further to the right. The y axis is vertical: larger values are further towards the bottom.
---
---In many cases, you draw images or shapes in terms of their upper-left corner.
---
---Many of the functions are used to manipulate the graphics coordinate system, which is essentially the way coordinates are mapped to the display. You can change the position, scale, and even rotation in this way.
---
---@class love.graphics
love.graphics = {}

---
---Applies the given Transform object to the current coordinate transformation.
---
---This effectively multiplies the existing coordinate transformation's matrix with the Transform object's internal matrix to produce the new coordinate transformation.
---
---@param transform love.Transform # The Transform object to apply to the current graphics coordinate transform.
function love.graphics.applyTransform(transform) end

---
---Draws a filled or unfilled arc at position (x, y). The arc is drawn from angle1 to angle2 in radians. The segments parameter determines how many segments are used to draw the arc. The more segments, the smoother the edge.
---
---@overload fun(drawmode: love.DrawMode, arctype: love.ArcType, x: number, y: number, radius: number, angle1: number, angle2: number, segments?: number)
---@param drawmode love.DrawMode # How to draw the arc.
---@param x number # The position of the center along x-axis.
---@param y number # The position of the center along y-axis.
---@param radius number # Radius of the arc.
---@param angle1 number # The angle at which the arc begins.
---@param angle2 number # The angle at which the arc terminates.
---@param segments? number # The number of segments used for drawing the arc.
function love.graphics.arc(drawmode, x, y, radius, angle1, angle2, segments) end

---
---Creates a screenshot once the current frame is done (after love.draw has finished).
---
---Since this function enqueues a screenshot capture rather than executing it immediately, it can be called from an input callback or love.update and it will still capture all of what's drawn to the screen in that frame.
---
---@overload fun(callback: function)
---@overload fun(channel: love.Channel)
---@param filename string # The filename to save the screenshot to. The encoded image type is determined based on the extension of the filename, and must be one of the ImageFormats.
function love.graphics.captureScreenshot(filename) end

---
---Draws a circle.
---
---@overload fun(mode: love.DrawMode, x: number, y: number, radius: number, segments: number)
---@param mode love.DrawMode # How to draw the circle.
---@param x number # The position of the center along x-axis.
---@param y number # The position of the center along y-axis.
---@param radius number # The radius of the circle.
function love.graphics.circle(mode, x, y, radius) end

---
---Clears the screen or active Canvas to the specified color.
---
---This function is called automatically before love.draw in the default love.run function. See the example in love.run for a typical use of this function.
---
---Note that the scissor area bounds the cleared region.
---
---In versions prior to 11.0, color component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.
---
---In versions prior to background color instead.

---@overload fun(color: table, ..., clearstencil?: boolean, cleardepth?: boolean)
---@overload fun(clearcolor: boolean, clearstencil: boolean, cleardepth: boolean)
function love.graphics.clear() end

---
---Discards (trashes) the contents of the screen or active Canvas. This is a performance optimization function with niche use cases.
---
---If the active Canvas has just been changed and the 'replace' BlendMode is about to be used to draw something which covers the entire screen, calling love.graphics.discard rather than calling love.graphics.clear or doing nothing may improve performance on mobile devices.
---
---On some desktop systems this function may do nothing.
---
---@overload fun(discardcolors: table, discardstencil?: boolean)
---@param discardcolor? boolean # Whether to discard the texture(s) of the active Canvas(es) (the contents of the screen if no Canvas is active.)
---@param discardstencil? boolean # Whether to discard the contents of the stencil buffer of the screen / active Canvas.
function love.graphics.discard(discardcolor, discardstencil) end

---
---Draws a Drawable object (an Image, Canvas, SpriteBatch, ParticleSystem, Mesh, Text object, or Video) on the screen with optional rotation, scaling and shearing.
---
---Objects are drawn relative to their local coordinate system. The origin is by default located at the top left corner of Image and Canvas. All scaling, shearing, and rotation arguments transform the object relative to that point. Also, the position of the origin can be specified on the screen coordinate system.
---
---It's possible to rotate an object about its center by offsetting the origin to the center. Angles must be given in radians for rotation. One can also use a negative scaling factor to flip about its centerline. 
---
---Note that the offsets are applied before rotation, scaling, or shearing; scaling and shearing are applied before rotation.
---
---The right and bottom edges of the object are shifted at an angle defined by the shearing factors.
---
---When using the default shader anything drawn with this function will be tinted according to the currently selected color.
---
---Set it to pure white to preserve the object's original colors.

---Draws many instances of a Mesh with a single draw call, using hardware geometry instancing.
---
---Each instance can have unique properties (positions, colors, etc.) but will not by default unless a custom per-instance vertex attributes or the love_InstanceID GLSL 3 vertex shader variable is used, otherwise they will all render at the same position on top of each other.

---Immediately renders any pending automatically batched draws.
---
---LÃ–VE will call this function internally as needed when most state is changed, so it is not necessary to manually call it.
---
---The current batch will be automatically flushed by love.graphics state changes (except for the transform stack and the current color), as well as Shader:send and methods on Textures which change their state. Using a different Image in consecutive love.graphics.draw calls will also flush the current batch.

---
---Gets the DPI scale factor of the window.
---
---The DPI scale factor represents relative pixel density. The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.graphics.getDPIScale() would return 2 in that case.
---
---The love.window.fromPixels and love.window.toPixels functions can also be used to convert between units.
---
---The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.

---
---Gets the current stencil test configuration.
---
---When stencil testing is enabled, the geometry of everything that is drawn afterward will be clipped / stencilled out based on a comparison between the arguments of this function and the stencil value of each pixel that the geometry touches. The stencil values of pixels are affected via love.graphics.stencil.

---Sets the scissor to the rectangle created by the intersection of the specified rectangle with the existing scissor.
---
---If no scissor is active yet, it behaves like love.graphics.setScissor.

---
---Converts the given 2D position from screen-space into global coordinates.

---
---Gets whether gamma-correct rendering is supported and enabled. It can be enabled by setting t.gammacorrect = true in love.conf.
---
---Not all devices support gamma-correct rendering, in which case it will be automatically disabled and this function will return false. It is supported on desktop systems which have graphics cards that are capable of using OpenGL 3 / DirectX 10, and iOS devices that can use OpenGL ES 3.

---
---Creates a new array Image.
---
---An array image / array texture is a single object which contains multiple 'layers' or 'slices' of 2D sub-images. It can be thought of similarly to a texture atlas or sprite sheet, but it doesn't suffer from the same tile / quad bleeding artifacts that texture atlases do â€“ although every sub-image must have the same dimensions.
---
---A specific layer of an array image can be drawn with love.graphics.drawLayer / SpriteBatch:addLayer, or with the Quad variant of love.graphics.draw and Quad:setLayer, or via a custom Shader.
---
---To use an array image in a Shader, it must be declared as a ArrayImage or sampler2DArray type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(ArrayImage image, vec3 texturecoord) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from a slice of the array image. The vec3 argument contains the texture coordinate in the first two components, and the 0-based slice index in the third component.
---

---
---Creates a new cubemap Image.
---
---Cubemap images have 6 faces (sides) which represent a cube. They can't be rendered directly, they can only be used in Shader code (and sent to the shader via Shader:send).
---
---To use a cubemap image in a Shader, it must be declared as a CubeImage or samplerCube type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(CubeImage image, vec3 direction) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from the cubemap. The vec3 argument is a normalized direction from the center of the cube, rather than explicit texture coordinates.
---
---Each face in a cubemap image must have square dimensions.
---
---For variants of this function which accept a single image containing multiple cubemap faces, they must be laid out in one of the following forms in the image:

---
---Creates a new Quad.
---
---The purpose of a Quad is to use a fraction of an image to draw objects, as opposed to drawing entire image. It is most useful for sprite sheets and atlases: in a sprite atlas, multiple sprites reside in same image, quad is used to draw a specific sprite from that image; in animated sprites with all frames residing in the same image, quad is used to draw specific frame from the animation.

---
---Creates a new Shader object for hardware-accelerated vertex and pixel effects. A Shader contains either vertex shader code, pixel shader code, or both.
---
---Shaders are small programs which are run on the graphics card when drawing. Vertex shaders are run once for each vertex (for example, an image has 4 vertices - one at each corner. A Mesh might have many more.) Pixel shaders are run once for each pixel on the screen which the drawn object touches. Pixel shader code is executed after all the object's vertices have been processed by the vertex shader.

---@return love.Video video # A new Video.
function love.graphics.newVideo(filename) end

---
---Creates a new volume (3D) Image.
---
---Volume images are 3D textures with width, height, and depth. They can't be rendered directly, they can only be used in Shader code (and sent to the shader via Shader:send).
---
---To use a volume image in a Shader, it must be declared as a VolumeImage or sampler3D type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(VolumeImage image, vec3 texcoords) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from the volume image. The vec3 argument is a normalized texture coordinate with the z component representing the depth to sample at (ranging from 1).
---
---Volume images are typically used as lookup tables in shaders for color grading, for example, because sampling using a texture coordinate that is partway in between two pixels can interpolate across all 3 dimensions in the volume image, resulting in a smooth gradient even when a small-sized volume image is used as the lookup table.
---
---Array images are a much better choice than volume images for storing multiple different sprites in a single array image for directly drawing them.
---
---@param layers table # A table containing filepaths to images (or File, FileData, ImageData, or CompressedImageData objects), in an array. A table of tables can also be given, where each sub-table represents a single mipmap level and contains all layers for that mipmap.

---@return love.Image image # A volume Image object.
function love.graphics.newVolumeImage(layers, settings) end

---
---Resets the current coordinate transformation.
---

---
---Draw a polygon.
---

---
---This function is always used to reverse a previous push operation. It returns the current transformation state to what it was before the last preceding push.

---
---Displays the results of drawing operations on the screen.
---
---This function is used when writing your own love.run function. It presents all the results of your drawing operations on the screen. See the example in love.run for a typical use of this function.
---

---
---Draws text on screen. If no Font is set, one will be created and set (once) if needed.
---
---As of LOVE 0.7.1, when using translation and scaling functions while drawing text, this function assumes the scale occurs first.
---
---If you don't script with this in mind, the text won't be in the right position, or possibly even on screen.
---
---love.graphics.print and love.graphics.printf both support UTF-8 encoding. You'll also need a proper Font for special characters.

---
---Draws formatted text, with word wrap and alignment.
---
---See additional notes in love.graphics.print.
---
---The word wrap limit is applied before any scaling, rotation, and other coordinate transformations. Therefore the amount of text per line stays constant given the same wrap limit, even if the scale arguments change.
---
---In version 0.9.2 and earlier, wrapping was implemented by breaking up words by spaces and putting them back together to make sure things fit nicely within the limit provided. However, due to the way this is done, extra spaces between words would end up missing when printed on the screen, and some lines could overflow past the provided wrap limit. In version 0.10.0 and newer this is no longer the case.

---Copies and pushes the current coordinate transformation to the transformation stack.
---

---
---Resets the current graphics settings.
---
---Calling reset makes the current drawing color white, the current background color black, disables any active color component masks, disables wireframe mode and resets the current graphics transformation to the origin. It also sets both the point and line drawing modes to smooth and their sizes to 1.0.

---
---@param angle number # The amount to rotate the coordinate system in radians.
function love.graphics.rotate(angle) end

---
---Scales the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---By default the coordinate system in LÃ–VE corresponds to the display pixels in horizontal and vertical directions one-to-one, and the x-axis increases towards the right while the y-axis increases downwards. Scaling the coordinate system changes this relation.
---
---After scaling by sx and sy, all coordinates are treated as if they were multiplied by sx and sy. Every result of a drawing operation is also correspondingly scaled, so scaling by (2, 2) for example would mean making everything twice as large in both x- and y-directions. Scaling by a negative value flips the coordinate system in the corresponding direction, which also means everything will be drawn flipped or upside down, or both. Scaling by zero is not a useful operation.
---
---Scale and translate are not commutative operations, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.
---
---Scaling lasts until love.draw() exits.

---A Canvas is used for off-screen rendering. Think of it as an invisible screen that you can draw to, but that will not be visible until you draw it to the actual visible screen. It is also known as "render to texture".
---
---By drawing things that do not change position often (such as background items) to the Canvas, and then drawing the entire Canvas instead of each item,  you can reduce the number of draw operations performed each frame.

---
---Gets the DPI scale factor of the Font.
---

---A Shader is used for advanced hardware-accelerated pixel or vertex manipulation. These effects are written in a language based on GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) with a few things simplified for easier coding.
---
---Potential uses for shaders include HDR/bloom, motion blur, grayscale/invert/sepia/any kind of color effect, reflection/refraction, distortions, bump mapping, and much more! Here is a collection of basic shaders and good starting point to learn: https://github.com/vrld/moonshine
---

---Gets whether a uniform / extern variable exists in the Shader.

---@return boolean hasuniform # Whether the uniform exists in the shader and affects its final output.
function Shader:hasUniform(name) end

---
---Sends one or more values to a special (''uniform'') variable inside the shader. Uniform variables have to be marked using the ''uniform'' or ''extern'' keyword, e.g.
---
---uniform float time;  // 'float' is the typical number type used in GLSL shaders.
---
---uniform float varsvec2 light_pos;
---
---uniform vec4 colors[4;
---
---The corresponding send calls would be
---

---
---shader:send('colors', {r1, g1, b1, a1},  {r2, g2, b2, a2},  {r3, g3, b3, a3},  {r4, g4, b4, a4})
---
---Uniform / extern variables are read-only in the shader code and remain constant until modified by a Shader:send call. Uniform variables can be accessed in both the Vertex and Pixel components of a shader, as long as the variable is declared in each.

---Different ways alpha affects color blending. See BlendMode and the BlendMode Formulas for additional notes.
---
---@alias love.BlendAlphaMode
---
---The RGB values of what's drawn are multiplied by the alpha values of those colors during blending. This is the default alpha mode.
---
---| "alphamultiply"
---
---The RGB values of what's drawn are '''not''' multiplied by the alpha values of those colors during blending. For most blend modes to work correctly with this alpha mode, the colors of a drawn object need to have had their RGB values multiplied by their alpha values at some point previously ("premultiplied alpha").
---
---| "premultiplied"

---
---Different ways to do color blending. See BlendAlphaMode and the BlendMode Formulas for additional notes.
---
---@alias love.BlendMode
---
---Alpha blending (normal). The alpha of what's drawn determines its opacity.

---
---The colors of what's drawn completely replace what was on the screen, with no additional blending. The BlendAlphaMode specified in love.graphics.setBlendMode still affects what happens.
---
---| "replace"
---
---'Screen' blending.
---
---| "screen"
---
---The pixel colors of what's drawn are added to the pixel colors already on the screen. The alpha of the screen is not modified.
---
---| "add"
---
---The pixel colors of what's drawn are subtracted from the pixel colors already on the screen. The alpha of the screen is not modified.
---
---| "subtract"
---
---The pixel colors of what's drawn are multiplied with the pixel colors already on the screen (darkening them). The alpha of drawn objects is multiplied with the alpha of the screen rather than determining how much the colors on the screen are affected, even when the "alphamultiply" BlendAlphaMode is used.
---
---| "multiply"
---
---The pixel colors of what's drawn are compared to the existing pixel colors, and the larger of the two values for each color component is used. Only works when the "premultiplied" BlendAlphaMode is used in love.graphics.setBlendMode.
---
---| "lighten"
---
---The pixel colors of what's drawn are compared to the existing pixel colors, and the smaller of the two values for each color component is used. Only works when the "premultiplied" BlendAlphaMode is used in love.graphics.setBlendMode.

---| "darken"
---
---Additive blend mode.
---
---| "additive"
---
---Subtractive blend mode.

---Multiply blend mode.
---
---| "multiplicative"
---
---Premultiplied alpha blend mode.

---* depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must be less than the existing depth value of that pixel.
---
---| "less"
---
---* stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must be less than or equal to the supplied value.
---* depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must be less than or equal to the existing depth value of that pixel.
---
---| "lequal"
---
---* stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must be greater than or equal to the supplied value.
---* depth tests: the depth value of the drawn object at that pixel must be greater than or equal to the existing depth value of that pixel.
---
---| "gequal"
---
---* stencil tests: the stencil value of the pixel must be greater than the supplied value.
