---
---The graphics module renders graphics and performs computation using the GPU.
---
---Most of the graphics functions are on the `Pass` object.
---
---@class lovr.graphics
lovr.graphics = {}

---
---Compiles shader code to SPIR-V bytecode.
---
---The bytecode can be passed to `lovr.graphics.newShader` to create shaders, which will be faster than creating it from GLSL. The bytecode is portable, so bytecode compiled on one platform will work on other platforms. This allows shaders to be precompiled in a build step.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---The input can be GLSL or SPIR-V.
---
---If it's SPIR-V, it will be returned unchanged as a Blob.
---
---If the shader fails to compile, an error will be thrown with the error message.
---
---@overload fun(stage: lovr.ShaderStage, blob: lovr.Blob):lovr.Blob
---@param stage lovr.ShaderStage # The type of shader to compile.
---@param source string # A string or filename with shader code.
---@return lovr.Blob bytecode # A Blob containing compiled SPIR-V code.
function lovr.graphics.compileShader(stage, source) end

---
---Returns the global background color.
---
---The textures in a render pass will be cleared to this color at the beginning of the pass if no other clear option is specified.
---
---Additionally, the headset and window will be cleared to this color before rendering.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Setting the background color in `lovr.draw` will apply on the following frame, since the default pass is cleared before `lovr.draw` is called.
---
---Internally, this color is applied to the default pass objects when retrieving one of them using `lovr.headset.getPass` or `lovr.graphics.getPass`.
---
---Both are called automatically by the default `lovr.run` implementation.
---
---Using the background color to clear the display is expected to be more efficient than manually clearing after a render pass begins, especially on mobile GPUs.
---
---@return number r # The red component of the background color.
---@return number g # The green component of the background color.
---@return number b # The blue component of the background color.
---@return number a # The alpha component of the background color.
function lovr.graphics.getBackgroundColor() end

---
---Creates a temporary Buffer.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---The format table can contain a list of `FieldType`s or a list of tables to provide extra information about each field.
---
---Each inner table has the following keys:
---
---- `type` is the `FieldType` of the field and is required.
---- `offset` is the byte offset of the field.
---
---Any fields with a `nil` offset will be placed next
---  to each other sequentially in memory, subject to any padding required by the Buffer's layout.
---  In practice this means that an `offset` should be set for either all of the fields or none of
---  them.
---- `location` is the vertex attribute location of each field.
---
---This is used to match up each
---  field with an attribute declared in a shader, and doesn't have any purpose when binding the
---  buffer as a uniform or storage buffer.
---
---Any fields with a `nil` location will use an
---  autoincrementing location starting at zero.
---
---Named locations are not currently supported, but
---  may be added in the future.
---
---If no table or Blob is used to define the initial Buffer contents, its data will be undefined.
---
---There is currently a max of 16 fields.

---
---Returns information about the graphics device and driver.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---The device and vendor ID numbers will usually be PCI IDs, which are standardized numbers consisting of 4 hex digits.
---
---Various online databases and system utilities can be used to look up these numbers.
---
---Here are some example vendor IDs for a few popular GPU manufacturers:
---
---<table>

---
---It is not currently possible to get the version of the driver, although this could be added.
---
---Regarding multiple GPUs: If OpenXR is enabled, the OpenXR runtime has control over which GPU is used, which ensures best compatibility with the VR headset.
---
---Otherwise, the "first" GPU returned by the renderer will be used.
---
---There is currently no other way to pick a GPU to use.

---Creates and returns a temporary Pass object.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Fun facts about render passes:
---
---- Textures must have the same dimensions, layer counts, and sample counts.
---- Textures must have been created with the `render` `TextureUsage`.
---- If `mipmap` is true, then any textures with mipmaps must have the `transfer` `TextureUsage`.
---- It's okay to have zero color textures, but in this case there must be a depth texture.
---- Setting `clear` to `false` for textures is usually very slow on mobile GPUs.
---
---For `compute` and `transfer` passes, all of the commands in the pass act as though they run in parallel.
---
---This means that writing to the same element of a buffer twice, or writing to it and reading from it again is not guaranteed to work properly on all GPUs.
---
---LÃ–VR is not currently able to check for this.
---
---If compute or transfers need to be sequenced, multiple passes should be used.

---
---Creates a new Texture.
---
---Image filenames or `Image` objects can be used to provide the initial pixel data and the dimensions, format, and type.
---
---Alternatively, dimensions can be provided, which will create an empty texture.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---If no `type` is provided in the options table, LÃ–VR will guess the `TextureType` of the Texture based on the number of layers:
---
---- If there's only 1 layer, the type will be `2d`.
---- If there are 6 images provided, the type will be `cube`.
---- Otherwise, the type will be `array`.
---
---Note that an Image can contain multiple layers and mipmaps.
---
---When a single Image is provided, its layer count will be used as the Texture's layer count.
---
---If multiple Images are used to initialize the Texture, they must all have a single layer, and their dimensions, format, and mipmap counts must match.
---
---When providing cubemap images in a table, they can be in one of the following forms:
---
---    { 'px.png', 'nx.png', 'py.png', 'ny.png', 'pz.png', 'nz.png' }
---    { right = 'px.png', left = 'nx.png', top = 'py.png', bottom = 'ny.png', back = 'pz.png', front = 'nz.png' }
---    { px = 'px.png', nx = 'nx.png', py = 'py.png', ny = 'ny.png', pz = 'pz.png', nz = 'nz.png' }
---
---(Where 'p' stands for positive and 'n' stands for negative).
---
---If no `usage` is provided in the options table, LÃ–VR will guess the `TextureUsage` of the Texture.
---
---The `sample` usage is always included, but if the texture was created without any images then the texture will have the `render` usage as well.
---
---The supported image formats are png, jpg, hdr, dds, ktx1, ktx2, and astc.

---
---Internally, this color is applied to the default pass objects when retrieving one of them using `lovr.headset.getPass` or `lovr.graphics.getPass`.

---
---
---### NOTE:

---Commands within a single Pass do not have any ordering guarantees.
---
---Submitting work to the GPU is not thread safe.
---
---No other `lovr.graphics` or `Pass` functions may run at the same time as `lovr.graphics.submit`.
---
---Calling this function will invalidate any temporary buffers or passes that were created during the frame.
---
---Submitting work to the GPU is a relatively expensive operation.
---
---It's a good idea to batch all `Pass` objects into 1 submission if possible, unless there's a good reason not to.
---
---One such reason would be that the frame has so much work that some of it needs to be submitted early to prevent the GPU from running out of things to do.
---
---Another would be for `Readback` objects.
---
---By default, this function is called with the default pass at the end of `lovr.draw` and `lovr.mirror`.
---

---
---A Buffer is a block of GPU memory.
---
---Buffers are similar to Lua tables or arrays: they have a length and store a list of values.
---
---The length of a Buffer and its format (the type of each value) are declared upfront and can't be changed.
---
---Each value of a Buffer consists of one or more fields, and each field has a type.
---
---For example, if a Buffer is used to store vertices, each value might store 3 fields for the position, normal vector, and UV coordinates of a vertex.
---
---Buffers are commonly used for:
---
---- Mesh data: Buffers hold the data that define the vertices in a mesh. Buffers also store the
---  vertex indices of a mesh, which define the order the vertices are connected together into
---  triangles. These are often called vertex buffers and index buffers.
---- Shader data: Buffers can be bound to a Shader, letting the Shader read arbitrary data. For
---  example, Lua code could create a Buffer with the positions and colors of all the lights in a
---  scene, which a Shader can use to do lighting calculations.
---- Compute: Compute shaders can write data to Buffers.
---
---This GPU-generated data can be used in
---  later rendering work or sent back to Lua.
---- Indirect: Indirect rendering is an advanced technique where instructions for rendering work
---  are recorded to a Buffer (potentially by a compute shader) and later drawn.
---
---There are two types of Buffers:
---
---- **Temporary** buffers are very inexpensive to create, and writing to them from Lua is fast.
---  However, they become invalid at the end of `lovr.draw` (i.e. when `lovr.graphics.submit` is
---  called).
---
---The GPU is slightly slower at accessing data from temporary buffers, and compute
---  shaders can not write to them.
---
---They are designed for storing data that changes every frame.
---- **Permanent** buffers are more expensive to create, and updating their contents requires a
---  transfer from CPU memory to VRAM.
---
---They act like normal LÃ–VR objects and don't need to be
---  recreated every frame.
---
---They often have faster performance when used by the GPU, and compute
---  shaders can write to them.
---
---They are great for large pieces of data that are initialized once
---  at load time, or data that is updated infrequently.
---
---@class lovr.Buffer
local Buffer = {}

---
---Clears some or all of the data in the **temporary** Buffer to zero.
---
---Permanent Buffers can be cleared in a transfer pass using `Pass:clear`.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Clearing a permanent buffer requires the byte offset and byte count of the cleared range to be a multiple of 4.
---
---This will usually be true for most data types.
---
---@param index? number # The index of the first item to clear.
---@param count? number # The number of items to clear.  If `nil`, clears to the end of the Buffer.
function Buffer:clear(index, count) end

---
---Returns the format of the Buffer.
---
---This is the list of fields that comprise each item in the buffer.
---
---Each field has a type, byte offset, and vertex attribute location.
---
---@return table format # The format of the Buffer.
function Buffer:getFormat() end

---
---Returns the length of the Buffer.
---
---@return number length # The length of the Buffer.
function Buffer:getLength() end

---
---Returns a raw pointer to the Buffer's memory as a lightuserdata, intended for use with the LuaJIT FFI or for passing to C libraries.
---
---This is only available for temporary buffers, so the pointer is only valid until `lovr.graphics.submit` is called.
---
---@return lightuserdata pointer # A pointer to the Buffer's memory.
function Buffer:getPointer() end

---
---Returns the size of the Buffer, in bytes.
---
---This is the same as `length * stride`.
---
---@return number size # The size of the Buffer, in bytes.
function Buffer:getSize() end

---
---Returns the distance between each item in the Buffer, in bytes.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---When a Buffer is created, the stride can be set explicitly, otherwise it will be automatically computed based on the fields in the Buffer.
---
---Strides can not be zero, and can not be smaller than the size of a single item.
---
---To work around this, bind the Buffer as a storage buffer and fetch data from the buffer manually.
---
---@return number stride # The stride of the Buffer, in bytes.
function Buffer:getStride() end

---
---Returns whether the Buffer is temporary.
---
---@return boolean temporary # Whether the Buffer is temporary.
function Buffer:isTemporary() end

---
---Changes data in a temporary Buffer using a table or a Blob.
---
---Permanent buffers can be changed using `Pass:copy`.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---When using a table, the table can contain a nested table for each value in the Buffer, or it can be a flat list of field component values.
---
---It is not possible to mix both nested tables and flat values.
---
---For each item updated, components of each field in the item (according to the Buffer's format) are read from either the nested subtable or the table itself.
---
---A single number can be used to update a field with a scalar type.
---
---Multiple numbers or a `lovr.math` vector can be used to update a field with a vector or mat4 type.
---
---Multiple numbers can be used to update mat2 and mat3 fields.
---
---When updating normalized field types, components read from the table will be clamped to the normalized range ([0,1] or [-1,1]).
---
---In the Buffer, each field is written at its byte offset according to the Buffer's format, and subsequent items are separated by the byte stride of the Buffer.
---
---Any missing components for an updated field will be set to zero.
---
---@overload fun(self: lovr.Buffer, blob: lovr.Blob, sourceOffset?: number, destinationOffset?: number, size?: number)

---
---Font objects are used to render text with `Pass:text`.
---
---The active font can be changed using `Pass:setFont`.
---
---The default font is Varela Round, which is used when no font is active, and can be retrieved using `lovr.graphics.getDefaultFont`.
---
---Custom fonts can be loaded from TTF files using `lovr.graphics.newFont`.
---
---Each Font uses a `Rasterizer` to load the TTF file and create images for each glyph. As text is drawn, the Font uploads images from the Rasterizer to a GPU texture atlas as needed.
---
---The Font also performs text layout and mesh generation for strings of text.
---
---LÃ–VR uses a text rendering technique called "multichannel signed distance fields" (MSDF), which makes the font rendering remain crisp when text is viewed up close.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---MSDF text requires a special shader to work.
---
---LÃ–VR will automatically switch to this shader if no shader is active on the `Pass`.
---
---This font shader is also available as a `DefaultShader`.
---
---@class lovr.Font

---
---Returns the pixel density of the font.
---
---The density is a "pixels per world unit" factor that controls how the pixels in the font's texture are mapped to units in the coordinate space.
---
---The default pixel density is set to the height of the font.
---
---This means that lines of text rendered with a scale of 1.0 come out to 1 unit (meter) tall.
---
---However, if this font was drawn to a 2D texture where the units are in pixels, the font would still be drawn 1 unit (pixel) tall!  Scaling the coordinate space or the size of the text by the height of the font would fix this.
---
---However, a more convenient option is to set the pixel density of the font to 1.0 when doing 2D rendering to make the font's size match up with the pixels of the canvas.

---
---
---### NOTE:
---Each vertex is a table of 4 floating point numbers with the following data:

---
---Materials are a set of properties and textures that define the properties of a surface, like what color it is, how bumpy or shiny it is, etc. `Shader` code can use the data from a material to compute lighting.
---
---Materials are immutable, and can't be changed after they are created.
---
---Instead, a new Material should be created with the updated properties.
---
---`Pass:setMaterial` changes the active material, causing it to affect rendering until the active material is changed again.
---
---Using material objects is optional.
---
---`Pass:setMaterial` can take a `Texture`, and `Pass:setColor` can change the color of objects, so basic tinting and texturing of surfaces does not require a full material to be created.
---
---Also, a custom material system could be developed by sending textures and other data to shaders manually.
---
---`Model` objects will create materials for all of the materials defined in the model file.
---
---In shader code, non-texture material properties can be accessed as `Material.<property>`, and material textures can be accessed as `<Type>Texture`, e.g. `RoughnessTexture`.

---
---Models are 3D model assets loaded from files.
---
---Currently, OBJ, glTF, and binary STL files are supported.
---
---A model can be drawn using `Pass:draw`.
---
---The raw CPU data for a model is held in a `ModelData` object, which can be loaded on threads or reused for multiple Model instances.
---
---Models have a hierarchy of nodes which can have their transforms modified.
---
---Meshes are attached to these nodes.
---
---The same mesh can be attached to multiple nodes, allowing it to be drawn multiple times while only storing a single copy of its data.
---
---Models can have animations.
---
---Animations have keyframes which affect the transforms of nodes. Right now each model can only be drawn with a single animated pose per frame.
---
---Models can have materials, which are collections of properties and textures that define how its surface is affected by lighting.
---
---Each mesh in the model can use a single material.
---
---@class lovr.Model
local Model = {}

---
---Animates a Model by setting or blending the transforms of nodes using data stored in the keyframes of an animation.
---
---The animation from the model file is evaluated at the timestamp, resulting in a set of node properties.
---
---These properties are then applied to the nodes in the model, using an optional blend factor.
---
---If the animation doesn't have keyframes that target a given node, the node will remain unchanged.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---If the timestamp is larger than the duration of the animation, it will wrap back around to zero, so looping an animation doesn't require using the modulo operator.
---
---To change the speed of the animation, multiply the timestamp by a speed factor.
---
---For each animated property in the animation, if the timestamp used for the animation is less than the timestamp of the first keyframe, the data of the first keyframe will be used.
---
---This function can be called multiple times to layer and blend animations.
---
---The model joints will be drawn in the final resulting pose.

---Pass objects are used to record commands for the GPU.
---
---Commands can be recorded by calling functions on the Pass.
---
---After recording a set of passes, they can be submitted for the GPU to process using `lovr.graphics.submit`.
---
---Pass objects are **temporary** and only exist for a single frame.
---
---Once `lovr.graphics.submit` is called to end the frame, any passes that were created during that frame become **invalid**. Each frame, a new set of passes must be created and recorded.
---
---LÃ–VR tries to detect if you use a pass after it's invalid, but this error checking is not 100% accurate at the moment.
---
---There are 3 types of passes.
---
---Each type can record a specific type of command:
---
---- `render` passes render graphics to textures.
---- `compute` passes run compute shaders.
---- `transfer` passes can transfer data to/from GPU objects, like `Buffer` and `Texture`.
---
---@class lovr.Pass
local Pass = {}

---
---Copies data between textures.
---
---Similar to `Pass:copy`, except the source and destination sizes can be different.
---
---The pixels from the source texture will be scaled to the destination size. This can only be called on a transfer pass, which can be created with `lovr.graphics.getPass`.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---When blitting between 3D textures, the layer counts do not need to match, and the layers will be treated as a continuous axis (i.e. pixels will be smoothed between layers).
---
---When blitting between array textures, the layer counts must match, and the blit occurs as a sequence of distinct 2D blits layer-by-layer.

---
---Runs a compute shader.
---
---Before calling this, a compute shader needs to be active, using `Pass:setShader`.
---
---This can only be called on a Pass with the `compute` type, which can be created using `lovr.graphics.getPass`.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Usually compute shaders are run many times in parallel: once for each pixel in an image, once per particle, once per object, etc.
---
---The 3 arguments represent how many times to run, or "dispatch", the compute shader, in up to 3 dimensions.
---
---Each element of this grid is called a **workgroup**.
---
---To make things even more complicated, each workgroup itself is made up of a set of "mini GPU threads", which are called **local workgroups**.
---
---Like workgroups, the local workgroup size can also be 3D.
---
---It's declared in the shader code, like this:
---
---    layout(local_size_x = w, local_size_y = h, local_size_z = d) in;
---
---All these 3D grids can get confusing, but the basic idea is to make the local workgroup size a small block of e.g. 32 particles or 8x8 pixels or 4x4x4 voxels, and then dispatch however many workgroups are needed to cover a list of particles, image, voxel field, etc.
---
---The reason to do it this way is that the GPU runs its threads in little fixed-size bundles called subgroups.
---
---Subgroups are usually 32 or 64 threads (the exact size is given by the `subgroupSize` property of `lovr.graphics.getDevice`) and all run together.
---
---If the local workgroup size was `1x1x1`, then the GPU would only run 1 thread per subgroup and waste the other 31 or 63.
---
---So for the best performance, be sure to set a local workgroup size bigger than 1!
---
---Inside the compute shader, a few builtin variables can be used to figure out which workgroup is running:
---
---- `uvec3 WorkgroupCount` is the workgroup count per axis (the `Pass:compute` arguments).
---- `uvec3 WorkgroupSize` is the local workgroup size (declared in the shader).
---- `uvec3 WorkgroupID` is the index of the current (global) workgroup.
---- `uvec3 LocalThreadID` is the index of the local workgroup inside its workgroup.
---- `uint LocalThreadIndex` is a 1D version of `LocalThreadID`.
---- `uvec3 GlobalThreadID` is the unique identifier for a thread within all workgroups in a
---  dispatch. It's equivalent to `WorkgroupID * WorkgroupSize + LocalThreadID` (usually what you
---  want!)
---
---Indirect compute dispatches are useful to "chain" compute shaders together, while keeping all of the data on the GPU.
---
---The first dispatch can do some computation and write some results to buffers, then the second indirect dispatch can use the data in those buffers to know how many times it should run.
---
---An example would be a compute shader that does some sort of object culling, writing the number of visible objects to a buffer along with the IDs of each one. Subsequent compute shaders can be indirectly dispatched to perform extra processing on the visible objects.
---
---Finally, an indirect draw can be used to render them.
---
---@overload fun(self: lovr.Pass, buffer: lovr.Buffer, offset?: number)
---@param x? number # The number of workgroups to dispatch in the x dimension.

---
---Enables or disables depth clamp.
---
---Normally, when pixels fall outside of the clipping planes, they are clipped (not rendered).
---
---Depth clamp will instead render these pixels, clamping their depth on to the clipping planes.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---This isn\'t supported on all GPUs.
---
---Use the `depthClamp` feature of `lovr.graphics.getFeatures` to check for support.

---
---
---### NOTE:
---When using LÃ–VR's default projection (reverse Z with infinite far plane) the default depth test is `gequal`, depth values of 0.0 are on the far plane and depth values of 1.0 are on the near plane, closer to the camera.

---
---Sets the projection for a single view.
---
---4 field of view angles can be used, similar to the field of view returned by `lovr.headset.getViewAngles`.
---
---Alternatively, a projection matrix can be used for other types of projections like orthographic, oblique, etc.
---
---Up to 6 views are supported.
---
---The Pass returned by `lovr.headset.getPass` will have its views automatically configured to match the headset.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---A far clipping plane of 0.0 can be used for an infinite far plane with reversed Z range.
---
---This is the default because it improves depth precision and reduces Z fighting.
---
---Using a non-infinite far plane requires the depth buffer to be cleared to 1.0 instead of 0.0 and the default depth test to be changed to `lequal` instead of `gequal`.

---
---Sets the active shader.
---
---In a render pass, the Shader will affect all drawing operations until it is changed again.
---
---In a compute pass, the Shader will be run when `Pass:compute` is called.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Changing the shader will preserve resource bindings (the ones set using `Pass:send`) **unless** the new shader declares a resource for a binding number using a different type than the current shader.
---
---In this case, the resource "type" means one of the following:
---
---- Uniform buffer (`uniform`).
---- Storage buffer (`buffer`).
---- Sampled texture, (`uniform texture<type>`).
---- Storage texture, (`uniform image<type>`).
---- Sampler (`uniform sampler`).
---
---If the new shader doesn't declare a resource in a particular binding number, any resource there will be preserved.
---
---If there's a clash in resource types like this, the variable will be "cleared".
---
---Using a buffer variable that has been cleared is not well-defined, and may return random data or even crash the GPU.
---
---For textures, white pixels will be returned.
---
---Samplers will use `linear` filtering and the `repeat` wrap mode.
---
---Changing the shader will not clear push constants set in the `Constants` block.

---Sets the stencil test.
---
---Any pixels that fail the stencil test won't be drawn.
---
---For example, setting the stencil test to `('equal', 1)` will only draw pixels that have a stencil value of 1. The stencil buffer can be modified by drawing while stencil writes are enabled with `lovr.graphics.setStencilWrite`.

---Sets the pose for a single view.
---
---Objects rendered in this view will appear as though the camera is positioned using the given pose.

---### NOTE:
---UTF-8 encoded strings are supported.
---
---Newlines will start a new line of text.
---
---Tabs will be rendered as four spaces.
---
---Carriage returns are ignored.
---

---
---Readbacks track the progress of an asynchronous read of a `Buffer`, `Texture`, or `Tally`.
---
---Once a Readback is created in a transfer pass, and the transfer pass is submitted, the Readback can be polled for completion or the CPU can wait for it to finish using `Readback:wait`.

---
---Also, samplers can be declared in shaders using the following syntax:
---
---    layout(set = 2, binding = X) uniform sampler mySampler;
---
---A Sampler can be sent to the variable using `Pass:send('mySampler', sampler)`.
---
---The properties of a Sampler are immutable, and can't be changed after it's created.
---
---@class lovr.Sampler

---
---Returns the anisotropy level of the Sampler.
---
---Anisotropy smooths out a texture's appearance when viewed at grazing angles.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Not all GPUs support anisotropy.
---
---The maximum anisotropy level is given by the `anisotropy` limit of `lovr.graphics.getLimits`, which may be zero.
---

function Sampler:getAnisotropy() end

---
---Returns the compare mode of the Sampler.
---
---This is a feature typically only used for shadow mapping.
---
---Using a sampler with a compare mode requires it to be declared in a shader as a `samplerShadow` instead of a `sampler` variable, and used with a texture that has a depth format.
---
---The result of sampling a depth texture with a shadow sampler is a number between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of sampled pixels that passed the comparison.

---
---Returns the workgroup size of a compute shader.
---
---The workgroup size defines how many times a compute shader is invoked for each workgroup dispatched by `Pass:compute`.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---For example, if the workgroup size is `8x8x1` and `16x16x16` workgroups are dispatched, then the compute shader will run `16 * 16 * 16 * (8 * 8 * 1) = 262144` times.

---
---Tally objects are able to measure events on the GPU.
---
---Tallies can measure three types of things:
---
---- `time` - measures elapsed GPU time.
---- `pixel` - measures how many pixels were rendered, which can be used for occlusion culling.
---- `shader` - measure how many times shaders were run.
---
---Tally objects can be created with up to 4096 slots.
---
---Each slot can hold a single measurement value.
---
---`Pass:tick` is used to begin a measurement, storing the result in one of the slots.
---
---All commands recorded on the Pass will be measured until `Pass:tock` is called with the same tally and slot.
---
---The measurement value stored in the slots can be copied to a `Buffer` using `Pass:copy`, or they can be read back to Lua using `Pass:read`.

---Textures are multidimensional blocks of memory on the GPU, contrasted with `Buffer` objects which are one-dimensional.
---
---Textures are used as the destination for rendering operations, and textures loaded from images provide surface data to `Material` objects.
---
---@class lovr.Texture

---
---3D and array textures have a variable number of layers.
---
---@return number layers # The layer count of the Texture.

function Texture:isView() end

---
---Creates a new Texture view.
---
---A texture view does not store any pixels on its own, but instead uses the pixel data of a "parent" Texture object.
---
---The width, height, format, sample count, and usage flags all match the parent.
---
---The view may have a different `TextureType` from the parent, and it may reference a subset of the parent texture's layers and mipmap levels.
---
---Texture views can be used as render targets in a render pass and they can be bound to Shaders. They can not currently be used for transfer operations.
---
---They are used for:
---
---- Reinterpretation of texture contents.
---
---For example, a cubemap can be treated as
---  an array texture.
---- Rendering to a particular image or mipmap level of a texture.
---- Binding a particular image or mipmap level to a shader.

---Controls whether premultiplied alpha is enabled.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---The premultiplied mode should be used if pixels being drawn have already been blended, or "pre-multiplied", by the alpha channel.
---
---This happens when rendering to a texture that contains pixels with transparent alpha values, since the stored color values have already been faded by alpha and don't need to be faded a second time with the alphamultiply blend mode.
---
---@alias lovr.BlendAlphaMode
---
---Color channel values are multiplied by the alpha channel during blending.
---
---| "alphamultiply"
---
---Color channel values are not multiplied by the alpha.
---
---Instead, it's assumed that the colors have already been multiplied by the alpha.
---
---This should be used if the pixels being drawn have already been blended, or "pre-multiplied".

---
---| "darken"
---
---The opposite of multiply: the pixel colors are inverted, multiplied, and inverted again, producing a lightening effect.
---
---| "screen"

---
---The different ways to pack Buffer fields into memory.
---
---The default is `packed`, which is suitable for vertex buffers and index buffers.
---
---It doesn't add any padding between elements, and so it doesn't waste any space.
---
---However, this layout won't necessarily work for uniform buffers and storage buffers.
---
---The `std140` layout corresponds to the std140 layout used for uniform buffers in GLSL.
---
---It adds the most padding between fields, and requires the stride to be a multiple of 16.
---
---Example:
---
---    layout(std140) uniform ObjectScales { float scales[64]; };
---
---The `std430` layout corresponds to the std430 layout used for storage buffers in GLSL.
---
---It adds some padding between certain types, and may round up the stride.
---
---Example:
---
---    layout(std430) buffer TileSizes { vec2 sizes[]; }
---
---@alias lovr.BufferLayout
---
---The packed layout, without any padding.
---
---| "packed"
---
---The std140 layout.
---

---### NOTE:
---This type can also be specified using mathematical notation, e.g. `=`, `>`, `<=`, etc. `notequal` can be provided as `~=` or `!=`.
---
---@alias lovr.CompareMode
---
---The test does not take place, and acts as though it always passes.
---
---| "none"
---
---The test passes if the values are equal.
---
---| "equal"
---
---The test passes if the values are not equal.
---
---| "notequal"
---
---The test passes if the value is less than the existing one.
---
---| "less"
---
---The test passes if the value is less than or equal to the existing one.
---
---| "lequal"
---
---The test passes if the value is greater than the existing one.
---
---| "greater"
---
---The test passes if the value is greater than or equal to the existing one.

---
---The set of shaders built in to LÃ–VR.
---
---These can be passed to `Pass:setShader` or `lovr.graphics.newShader` instead of writing GLSL code.
---
---The shaders can be further customized by using the `flags` option to change their behavior.
---
---If the active shader is set to `nil`, LÃ–VR picks one of these shaders to use.
---
---@alias lovr.DefaultShader
---
---Basic shader without lighting that uses colors and a texture.
---
---| "unlit"

---
---The shape will be filled in (the default).
---
---| "fill"
---
---The shape will be outlined.
---
---| "line"

---
---Different types for `Buffer` fields.
---
---These are scalar, vector, or matrix types, usually packed into small amounts of space to reduce the amount of memory they occupy.
---
---The names are encoded as follows:
---
---- The data type:
---  - `i` for signed integer
---  - `u` for unsigned integer
---  - `sn` for signed normalized (-1 to 1)
---  - `un` for unsigned normalized (0 to 1)
---  - `f` for floating point
---- The bit depth of each component
---- The letter `x` followed by the component count (for vectors)
---
---
---### NOTE:
---In addition to these values, the following aliases can be used:

---  <thead>
---    <tr>
---      <td>Alias</td>
---      <td>Maps to</td>

---
---Additionally, the following convenience rules apply:
---
---- Field types can end in an `s`, which will be stripped off.

---
---Different ways vertices in a mesh can be connected together and filled in with pixels.
---
---@alias lovr.MeshMode
---
---Each vertex is rendered as a single point.
---
---The size of the point can be controlled using the `pointSize` shader flag, or by writing to the `PointSize` variable in shaders.

---
---The three different types of `Pass` objects.
---
---Each Pass has a single type, which determines the type of work it does and which functions can be called on it.
---
---@alias lovr.PassType
---
---A render pass renders graphics to a set of up to four color textures and an optional depth texture.
---
---The textures all need to have the same dimensions and sample counts.
---
---The textures can have multiple layers, and all rendering work will be broadcast to each layer.
---
---Each layer can use a different camera pose, which is used for stereo rendering.
---
---| "render"
---
---A compute pass runs compute shaders.
---
---Compute passes usually only call `Pass:setShader`, `Pass:send`, and `Pass:compute`.
---
---All of the compute work in a single compute pass is run in parallel, so multiple compute passes should be used if one compute pass needs to happen after a different one.
---
---| "compute"
---
---A transfer pass copies data to and from GPU memory in `Buffer` and `Texture` objects. Transfer passes use `Pass:copy`, `Pass:clear`, `Pass:blit`, `Pass:mipmap`, and `Pass:read`. Similar to compute passes, all the work in a transfer pass happens in parallel, so multiple passes should be used if the transfers need to be ordered.
---
---| "transfer"

---Similar to decrement, but will wrap around to 255 when it goes below 0.
---
---| "decrementwrap"
---
---The bits in the stencil buffer pixels will be inverted.
---
---| "invert"

---
---These are the different metrics a `Tally` can measure.
---
---@alias lovr.TallyType
---
---Each slot measures elapsed time in nanoseconds.
---
---| "time"
---
---Each slot measures 4 numbers: the total number of vertices processed, the number of times the vertex shader was run, the number of triangles that were visible in the view, and the number of times the fragment shader was run.
---
---| "shader"
---
---Each slot measures the approximate number of pixels affected by rendering.
---
---| "pixel"

---
---These are the different ways `Texture` objects can be used.
---
---These are passed in to `lovr.graphics.isFormatSupported` to see which texture operations are supported by the GPU for a given format.
---
---@alias lovr.TextureFeature
---
---The Texture can be sampled (e.g. a `texture2D` or `sampler2D` variable in shaders).
---
---| "sample"
---
---The Texture can be used with a `Sampler` using a `FilterMode` of `linear`.
---
---| "filter"

---Destination textures in `Pass:blit` can use this format.
---
---| "blitdst"

---
---Different types of textures.
---
---Textures are multidimensional blocks of GPU memory, and the texture's type determines how many dimensions there are, and adds some semantics about what the 3rd dimension means.
---
---@alias lovr.TextureType
---
---A single 2D image, the most common type.
---
---| "2d"
---
---A 3D image, where a sequence of 2D images defines a 3D volume.
---
---Each mipmap level of a 3D texture gets smaller in the x, y, and z axes, unlike cubemap and array textures.
---
---| "3d"
---
---Six square 2D images with the same dimensions that define the faces of a cubemap, used for skyboxes or other "directional" images.
---
---| "cube"
---
---Array textures are sequences of distinct 2D images that all have the same dimensions.
---
---| "array"

---
---These are the different things `Texture`s can be used for.
---
---When creating a Texture, a set of these flags can be provided, restricting what operations are allowed on the texture.
---
---Using a smaller set of flags may improve performance.
---
---If none are provided, the only usage flag applied is `sample`.
