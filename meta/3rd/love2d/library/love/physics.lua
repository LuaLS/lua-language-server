---
---All coordinates in the physics module are divided by this number, creating a convenient way to draw the objects directly to the screen without the need for graphics transformations.
---
---It is recommended to create shapes no larger than 10 times the scale. This is important because Box2D is tuned to work well with shape sizes from 0.1 to 10 meters.

---
---Creates a new body.
---
---There are three types of bodies. 
---
---* Static bodies do not move, have a infinite mass, and can be used for level boundaries. 
---
---* Dynamic bodies are the main actors in the simulation, they collide with everything. 
---
---* Kinematic bodies do not react to forces and only collide with dynamic bodies.
---
---The mass of the body gets calculated when a Fixture is attached or removed, but can be changed at any time with Body:setMass or Body:resetMassData.

---@param radius number # The radius of the circle.
---@return love.CircleShape shape # The new shape.
function love.physics.newCircleShape(radius) end

---
---Creates a DistanceJoint between two bodies.
---
---This joint constrains the distance between two points on two bodies to be constant. These two points are specified in world coordinates and the two bodies are assumed to be in place when this joint is created. The first anchor point is connected to the first body and the second to the second body, and the points define the length of the distance joint.

---
---Create a GearJoint connecting two Joints.
---
---The gear joint connects two joints that must be either  prismatic or  revolute joints. Using this joint requires that the joints it uses connect their respective bodies to the ground and have the ground as the first body. When destroying the bodies and joints you must make sure you destroy the gear joint before the other joints.
---
---The gear joint has a ratio the determines how the angular or distance values of the connected joints relate to each other. The formula coordinate1 + ratio * coordinate2 always has a constant value that is set when the gear joint is created.

---
---Create a joint between a body and the mouse.
---
---This joint actually connects the body to a fixed point in the world. To make it follow the mouse, the fixed point must be updated every timestep (example below).
---
---The advantage of using a MouseJoint instead of just changing a body position directly is that collisions and reactions to other joints are handled by the physics engine. 
---
---@param body love.Body # The body to attach to the mouse.
---@param x number # The x position of the connecting point.
---@param y number # The y position of the connecting point.

---
---Creates a PrismaticJoint between two bodies.
---
---A prismatic joint constrains two bodies to move relatively to each other on a specified axis. It does not allow for relative rotation. Its definition and operation are similar to a  revolute joint, but with translation and force substituted for angle and torque.

---
---Creates a PulleyJoint to join two bodies to each other and the ground.
---
---The pulley joint simulates a pulley with an optional block and tackle. If the ratio parameter has a value different from one, then the simulated rope extends faster on one side than the other. In a pulley joint the total length of the simulated rope is the constant length1 + ratio * length2, which is set when the pulley joint is created.
---
---Pulley joints can behave unpredictably if one side is fully extended. It is recommended that the method  setMaxLengths  be used to constrain the maximum lengths each side can attain.

---Sets the pixels to meter scale factor.
---
---All coordinates in the physics module are divided by this number and converted to meters, and it creates a convenient way to draw the objects directly to the screen without the need for graphics transformations.
---

---Applies an angular impulse to a body. This makes a single, instantaneous addition to the body momentum.
---
---A body with with a larger mass will react less. The reaction does '''not''' depend on the timestep, and is equivalent to applying a force continuously for 1 second. Impulses are best used to give a single push to a body. For a continuous push to a body it is better to use Body:applyForce.
---
---@param impulse number # The impulse in kilogram-square meter per second.
function Body:applyAngularImpulse(impulse) end

---
---Apply force to a Body.
---
---A force pushes a body in a direction. A body with with a larger mass will react less. The reaction also depends on how long a force is applied: since the force acts continuously over the entire timestep, a short timestep will only push the body for a short time. Thus forces are best used for many timesteps to give a continuous push to a body (like gravity). For a single push that is independent of timestep, it is better to use Body:applyLinearImpulse.
---
---If the position to apply the force is not given, it will act on the center of mass of the body. The part of the force not directed towards the center of mass will cause the body to spin (and depends on the rotational inertia).
---

---
---Gets the Angular damping of the Body
---
---The angular damping is the ''rate of decrease of the angular velocity over time'': A spinning body with no damping and no external forces will continue spinning indefinitely. A spinning body with damping will gradually stop spinning.
---
---Damping is not the same as friction - they can be modelled together. However, only damping is provided by Box2D (and LOVE).
---
---Damping parameters should be between 0 and infinity, with 0 meaning no damping, and infinity meaning full damping. Normally you will use a damping value between 0 and 0.1.
---

---
---Get the angular velocity of the Body.
---
